# Learn Node

Just a little playground for me to play around with Node and Express to learn a bit more about 
modern JavaScript.

As I work through different tutorials and lessons, I'll create a branch of the material I was working with while I was 
studying, and push all of that code into that branch. That way, the `main` branch is always the current information
and lessons I'm working through, but I also retain a little trail of where I've been.

In May 2021, I was working through the documentation in https://nodejs.dev/learn.

In July 2021, I purchased 
[Node.js Web Development: Service-side web development made easy with Node 14 using practical examples, 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Web-Development-Server-side-development-ebook/dp/B08BWRBPXT)
by David Herron, and the main branch reflects code I've jotted down and/or modified while studying from that book. The
latest code samples in the `main` branch reflect those sessions.
